# loginSystem

## What I was actually doing?
Was actually trying to make a login system with email verification.But turns out Pure php and smtp functionality isn't the best way to do it because of the fact the 
fact that my authentication credentials would be out there for everyone to see.

## What I did instead?
I just made a simple login system.

## Not impressive but give it a look hehe.....
